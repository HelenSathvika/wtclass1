<li><h2>Fold Mountains:</h2>
    <h3>Fold mountains are created through a process called orogeny. An orogenic event takes millions of years to create a fold mountain. When a tectonic plate gets pressure from two sides, it gets folded. Some of its portion becomes elevated and forms the mountains.The depressions form the valleys. The Himalayas, The Andes and the Alps are examples of Fold Mountain. They are the young mountains of the world and hence they have some of the highest peaks of the world.</h3>
