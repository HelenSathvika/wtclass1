<h1><b>Message Format</b></h1>
</center>
<p>When a client and a web service communicate they exchange messages. A request message is sent from the client to the web service. The web service responds with a response message. This is just like in ordinary HTTP, where a web browser sends an HTTP request to a web server, and the web server replies with an HTTP response.</p>
<br>
<p>In the beginning the only web service message format available was SOAP. Later came REST type web services, which uses plain XML and HTTP. Following the REST movement came a wave of people using JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) as message format. Another very simple remoting protocol is called XML-RPC (XML Remote Procedure Call). Of these, the most common is SOAP and I will not get into details with these message formats here, since they will get their own tutorial trails later. I will just briefly mention what they look like.</p>
